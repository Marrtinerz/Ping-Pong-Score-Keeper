# Ping-Pong-Score-Keeper

This web app was created using HTML5, Pure CSS3, and Vanilla JS.
I am currently in my learning phase with Colt Steele on Udemy, and I coded this myself before his codeAlong using Bulma. Since I'm not yet knowledgeable of Bulma, I employed pure CSS.

Learning points: 
1. Properly structuring my code: I moved from selections to functions and then to events. This was helpful in following and understanding the code.
2. Comment insertion: I was happy with the comments I added to the JS code. It increased the readability of my code.
3. Styling the Select element: this required some research on stackoverflow and MDN developers, but I was able to make it work, and I liked the result.

Future Learning plans
I plan to continue the course on Udemy, and eventually code a nice CRUD website with ease.
I'll also check out Bulma, and see what they have to offer.
